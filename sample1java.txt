HISTORY OF JAVA
Java was conceived by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and
Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems, Inc. in 1991. It took 18 months to develop the first
Working version. This language was initially
Between the initial implementation of Oak in the fall of 1992 and the public Announcement of
Java in the spring of 1995, many more people contributed to the designand evolution of the
language. Bill Joy, Arthur van Hoff, Jonathan Payne, Frank Yellin, and Tim Lind Holm were key
contributors to the maturing of the original prototype.
The trouble With C and C++ (and most other languages) is that they are designed to be
compiled For a specific target. Although it is possible to compile a C++ program for just about
Any type of CPU, to do so requires a full C++ compiler targeted for that CPU. The Problem is
that compilers are expensive and time-consuming to create. An easier—and more costefficient—solution was needed. In an attempt to find such a solution,Gosling and others began
work on a portable, platform-independent language thatcould be used to produce code that would
run on a variety of CPUs under differing Environments. This effort ultimately led to the creation
of Java.
As mentioned earlier, Java derives much of its character from C and C++. This is by
intent. The Java designers knew that using the familiar syntax of C and echoing the objectoriented features of C++ would make their language appealing to the legions of experienced
C/C++ programmers. In addition to the surface similarities, Java shares some of the other
attributes that helped make C and C++ successful. First, Java was designed, tested, and refined
by real, working programmers.
